We have created a simple pokedex app for people to use to search for specific kinds of pokemons, depending on their attributes.

You can search pokemon by their type, minimum attack points, minimum defense points, minimum health points, pokemon name and pokemon number.

There is also a random button which would display 20 random pokemon.

Otherwise, after the criteria has been selected, the app should move to a screen that displays the list of all relevant pokemon.

From there, you can choose whichever pokemon you want to view from the search results page, and it should go to a detailed screen that displays the poekmons name, number, picture and all the available statistics.
